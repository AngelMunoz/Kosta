# Kosta
This is a small skeleton for a [Koa] application, it includes JWT Auth,
SQL Server Integration via [Knex] and a [Winston] based Logger

>Using Knex means that you can just plug any other sql database, like mysql, maria or even postgres

Fairly simple and full async/await.

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install
```
